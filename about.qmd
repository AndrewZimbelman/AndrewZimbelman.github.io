My name is Andrew Zimbelman. I am a 3rd year Ecosystem Science & Sustainability major who is interested in regenerative agriculture, sustainable urban development, and environmental justice. In my career I am driven to finding ways to connect our agricultural system to underprivileged urban communities that are victims to policies that have created food deserts. I am confident my work will provide nutritious, affordable, healthy food to under supported regions of Colorado!

I have held various positions over the course of my career, I have worked in a variety of places from fast food to out on farms. My most significant work experience has come from my time in high school to now. ,where I first started working as a carryout at my local nursery Echter's. Being a carryout demanded that I have knowledge over various types of plant's as well as the knowledge to properly identify and recommend various types of mulch, compost, and soil types.

My outdoor's experience does not end here. I have also volunteered for the Wildland Restoration volutneer group. My Volunteer work with this group has focused on 2 significant projects. The first project focuses on planting cover crops for a local farm in Longmont to ensure a more sustainable farming ecosystem was able to persist in various Colorado climates, we did so by planting crops that were designed to protect against wind shearing by digging holes that were around 1-2 feet into the ground, we then gently broke up the plant soil, ensuring there was a higher surface area for root movement to increase land coverage and decrease root competiton, we then placed a layer of mycelia on top of the plants, and then a layer of dirt on top to protect the mycelia from the potential damage from the sun. On top of this, we also worked on creating a beautiful pollinator garden to support a more natural & sustainable farm ecosystem. The second volunteer project focused on ecosystem restoration in an outdoors area in Loveland. In this project, we removed pests, weeds, and dead plants to plant fresh soil with early succesional plant species that would help to restore the ecosytem. We did this the use of various tools such as shovels and pickaxes to remove rock and make room for new plants and soil, which we planted deep in the soil to ensure that their roots could grow into the neighboring soil, allowing them to properly establish and grow.

My most recent experience has been at Colorado State Universities largest dining hall known as, "Ram's Horn". At Ram's Horn I am one of the student supervisors, and my job is to train and monitor the tasks of up to 20 student hourlies each shift. I am responsible for ensuring proper sanitization, and food safety standards are met according to HACCP (Hazard Analysis for Critical Control Points). My job also involves managing data for all team members in shift, logging documentation, call-outs, and incidents that occur each day. Finally. I am frequently responsible for opening and closing the building on different shifts. These shifts range from 6 am in the morning to 12 am at night. I am expected to guide my team of up to 20 members to detail oriented opening and closing procedures that ensure the dining hall is prepared for success and maximizing customer service each and every day.
