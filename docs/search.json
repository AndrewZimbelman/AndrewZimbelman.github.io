    "text": "My name is Andrew Zimbelman. I am a 3rd year Ecosystem Science & Sustainability major who is interested in regenerative agriculture, sustainable urban development, and environmental justice. In my career I am driven to finding ways to connect our agricultural system to underprivileged urban communities that are victims to policies that have created food deserts. I am confident my work will provide nutritious, affordable, healthy food to under supported regions of Colorado!\n\nI have held various positions over the course of my career, I have worked in a variety of places from fast food to out on farms. My most significant work experience has come from my time in highschool to now. ,where I first started working as a carryout at my local nursery Echter’s. Being a carryout demanded that I have knowledge over various types of plant’s as well as the knowledge to properly identify and recommend various types of mulch, compost, and soil types.\nMy outdoor’s experience does not end here. I have also volunteered for the Wildland Restoration volutneer group. My Volunteer work with this group has focused on 2 significant projects. The first project focuses on planting cover crops for a local farm in Longmont to ensure a more sustainable farming ecosystem was able to persist in various extreme weather events, on top of this we also fworked on creating a beatiful pollinator garden to support a more natural & sustainable farm ecosystem. The second project focused on ecosystem restoration in an outdoors area in Loveland. In this project, we removed pests, weeds, and dead plants to plant fresh soil with early succesional plant species that would help to rejuvinate the ecossytem.\nMy most recent experience has been at Colorado State Universities largest dining hall known as, “Ram’s Horn”. I am one of the student supervisors at ram’s horn and my job is to train and monitor the tasks of up to 20 student hourlies each shift. I am responsible for ensuring proper sanitization, and food safety standards are met according to HACCP (Hazard Analysis for Critical Control Points). My job also involves managing data for all team members in shift, logging documentation, callouts, and incidents that occur each day. Finally. I am frequently responsbile for opening and closing the building on different shifts. These shifts range from 6 am in the morning to 12 am at night. I am expected to guide my team of up to 20 members to detail oriented opening and closing procedures that ensure the dining hall is prepared for success and maximizing customer service each and every day."

    "text": "I have done various projects throughout my career. My first project invovled a literature review on coral reef acidification. Where I learned that the causes of coral reef acidification were due to increased carbon emissions from polluters, which lead to acidification as well as impacting fish species cognitive abilites and predator vigilance. Overall, carbon acidification altered predator prey ecosystem dynamics as well as affecting ecosystem services.\nI have also written a paper on environmental injustice in low income neighborhoods. This paper’s was written in a informative setting meant for everyone to understand. My paper found that individuals in low income areas were more likely to live near polluters, trains, and waste disposal sites that lead to asthma in children and negative health affects in all ages.\nMy most significant work was my work in ArcGIS, where I worked on a wolverine suitability analysis in the Big Thompson Watershed. This project used various wolverine niche factors, such as how far they travel each day, and preferred snow elevations. This project involved various techniques such as: model builder, data collection and modification, reclassified tools, vector to raster tools, as well as project creating through canva. This project taught me a lot about how to conduct a project from a start with nothing to work off of. It taught me how to find sources of inforomation and challeneged me to parse data efficiently as I had to do this whole project in 2 weeks."
